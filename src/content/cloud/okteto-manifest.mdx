The Okteto Manifest allows you to define how to build, deploy and develop in your development environment.

### Example okteto.yml

```yaml
icon: https://apps.okteto.com/movies/icon.png
build:
  api:
    context: .
deploy:
  - helm upgrade --install app chart --set image=${OKTETO_BUILD_API_IMAGE}
dev:
  api:
    command: ["bash"]
    forward:
      - 8080:8080
      - 9229:9229
    sync:
      - .:/usr/src/app
```

This sample shows how to `build` the container image of the **api** microservice,
how to `deploy` the api microservice using its helm chart,
and how to develop on it by synchronizing the local filesystem on the container path `/usr/src/app`.

### Built-in tools

When launching a development environment from a Git Repository,
Okteto will run an installation job that clones the Git repository,
checks out the selected branch,
builds the images defined in the `build` section of your Okteto Manifest,
and executes the sequence of `deploy` commands.
The job will fail if any of the commands in the `deploy` list fails.

The installation job will run in a Debian Linux container with the following tools preinstalled:

- `bash`
- `bazel`
- `cue`
- `curl`
- `envsubst`
- `git`
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `make`
- `okteto`
- `openssh`
- `wait-for-it`

The installation job container is automatically configured with credentials to use the above tools on the namespace where your development environment is deployed.

### Built-in Environment Variables

The installation job also populates the following environment variables. You can refer to this in your `deploy` commands if needed:

- `OKTETO_NAMESPACE`: the namespace where your application is going to be installed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_BRANCH`: the name of the Git branch currently being deployed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT`: the SHA1 hash of the last commit of the branch.
- `OKTETO_REGISTRY_URL`: the url of the [Okteto Registry](/docs/cloud/registry/).
- `BUILDKIT_HOST`: the address of the [Okteto Cloud buildkit instance](/docs/cloud/build/). You can use it to build your images with any CLI tool that supports Buildkit builds.

In order to refer to images in the `build` section of the Okteto Manifest, you can use the following environment variables:

- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_TAG}`: SHA for the last image build at the registry
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_REGISTRY}`: the registry URL where the image was pushed
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_REPOSITORY}`: the name of the image that was pushed (`namespace/_<service>`)
- `${OKTETO_BUILD_<service>_IMAGE}`: the full image reference (using its SHA)
