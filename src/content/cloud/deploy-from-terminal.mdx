You have full access to your Kubernetes namespaces on Okteto Cloud directly from your terminal, using the tools you're already familiar with, such as `helm`, `kubectl`, `okteto` or `skaffold`.

A part of using the [Okteto CLI](/docs/reference/cli/) and the [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest/) to deploy your development environment, you can also interact with your Okteto Namespace with any other Kubernetes CLI tool like `kubectl` or `helm`.


## Download your Kubernetes credentials

In order to access your namespaces from your terminal, download your Kubernetes credentials from Okteto Cloud.
[This document](/docs/cloud/credentials/) will walk you through the necessary steps for this.

## Deploy your Application

Once the credentials have been configured, deploy your applications using your favorite CLI tool.
For example, you could use `kubectl` to deploy our `hello-world` application:

```terminal
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okteto/go-getting-started/master/k8s.yml
```

Okteto Cloud is a multi-tenant environment.
A combination of RBAC, pod security policies, resource quotas, network policies, admission controllers, and custom code is put in-place to ensure that Okteto Cloud namespaces are isolated, secure, and easy to use for everyone.
[Take a look at this document](/docs/cloud/multitenancy/) to understand the limitations and restrictions most likely to affect your applications in Okteto Cloud.
