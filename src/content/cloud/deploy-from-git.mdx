<!-- This document covers how to deploy a development environment for a given Git repository.
Note that your Git repository needs to be configured with an [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/).
Read the Okteto Pipeline [getting started guide](/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-pipelines/) to learn how to create an Okteto Pipeline for your Git repository. -->

## Prerequisites

When you deploy a Git repository, Okteto will analyze the source code of your Git repository, looking for clues on how to deploy your development environment.

Okteto will look for deployment manifests in the following order:

1. [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest/) file: if your repository has an `okteto.yml` or `.okteto/okteto.yml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto deploy --build` on the manifest file.
1. [Okteto Pipeline](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) file (**deprecated**): if your repository has an `okteto-pipeline.yml` or `.okteto/okteto-pipeline.yml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto deploy` on the pipeline manifest file.
1. [Docker Compose](/docs/reference/compose/) file: if your repository has a `okteto-compose.yaml` or `docker-compose.yaml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `okteto deploy --build` on this file.
1. [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/): if your repository has a `chart`, `charts`, `helm/chart`, or `helm/charts` directory with a `Chart.yaml` file in it, Okteto will detect the chart and run `helm upgrade --install` on it.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) folder: if your repository has a `manifests`, `kubernetes`, or `k8s` folder, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` on the folder.
1. [Kubernetes manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/) file: if your repository has a `manifests.yaml`, `kubernetes.yaml`, or `k8s.yaml` file, Okteto will detect it and run `kubectl apply` on the manifest file.

### Built-in tools

Okteto will run an installation job that clones your Git repository, checks out the selected branch, and executes the sequence of `deploy` commands. The job will fail if any of the commands in the `deploy` list fails.

The installation job will run in a Debian Linux container with the following tools preinstalled:

- `bash`
- `bazel`
- `cue`
- `curl`
- `envsubst`
- `git`
- `helm`
- `kubectl`
- `kustomize`
- `make`
- `okteto`
- `openssh`
- `wait-for-it`

The installation job container is automatically configured with credentials to use the above tools on the namespace where your development environment is deployed.

> Are we missing any binaries you use? File [an issue here](https://github.com/okteto/cloud-feedback/issues/new) and we will do our best to make it available.

### Built-in Environment Variables
The installation job also populates the following environment variables. You can refer to this in your `deploy` commands if needed:

- `OKTETO_NAMESPACE`: the namespace where your development environment is going to be deployed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_BRANCH`: the name of the Git branch currently being deployed.
- `OKTETO_GIT_COMMIT`: the SHA1 hash of the last commit of the branch.
- `OKTETO_REGISTRY_URL`: the url of the [Okteto Registry](/docs/cloud/registry/).
- `BUILDKIT_HOST`: the address of the [Okteto Cloud buildkit instance](/docs/cloud/build/). You can use it to build your images with any CLI tool that supports Buildkit builds.

## Deploy

Log in to [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com), and click on the **Deploy** button on the top left.
A dialog will open asking for a Git repository to deploy. Make sure that "**Git URL**" is selected as the source.
Type the URL for the Movies App repo (https://github.com/okteto/movies), pick a branch, and click **Deploy**:

When you deploy a Git repository, Okteto Cloud will analyze your repo and automatically deploy it.
In the example above, Okteto will install the chart of the Movies App with Helm.

> Check the [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest/) to learn more about how to configure your development environment deployment with an `okteto.yml` file.

As soon as your development environment is deployed, you'll see its state in the UI. The UI will be automatically updated as the different components are created.
Your development environment will be ready to go once it reaches the `Success` state.

## Redeploy

Click the **Redeploy** button on the right of your development environment.

A dialog will open where you can modify the branch to redeploy:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/redeploy-git.png" alt="Redeploy in git" width="600" /></p>

Click **Deploy** and your development environment will be updated with the source code of the given branch.

## Destroy

You can also destroy your development environment with a single click.

Go back to the extended menu of your development environment and click the **Destroy** button.
A confirmation dialog will pop up. Click on **Destroy** and your development environment and all of the resources created for it will be gone:

<p align="center"><Image src="/docs/cloud/images/destroy-git.png" alt="Destroy application" width="450" /></p>

You won't be able to recover resources after the development environment has been destroyed, so back up any sensitive data before running this action.

## Variables

When you deploy from Git, you can add Variables that will be available as environment variables during the deployment of your development environment.

## Adding a Develop on Okteto Button

The **Develop on Okteto** button is a shortcut to deploy your development environments with a single click.

The button is designed to be used in GitHub README files, documentation sites, or pretty much anywhere that renders an HTML file.
Use this instead of writing a never-ending list of manual steps on how to deploy your development environments.

Here's an example button that deploys [the Movies App](https://github.com/okteto/movies) on Okteto Cloud.

[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies)

### Adding the Develop on Okteto button

There are two ways of referencing the source code repository:
- Resolve it implicitly. This is useful in GitHub `README.` files. If you don't specify the repository, Okteto will infer it using the `referer` header. This only works on public repositories hosted in https://github.com.
- Using the `repository` and `branch` parameters. This is useful for buttons hosted outside of https://github.com, in blog posts, or documentation.

#### Using an implicit repository

If you're embedding the button in a public GitHub repository's `README` file, Okteto will automatically infer the repository and the branch using the referer header when someone clicks on the button.

Here's an example:

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a href="https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy">
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto">
</a>
```

A `develop-okteto.png` is also available.

#### Adding explicit parameters

Use the following Markdown snippet as a template, changing the `repository` and `branch` query parameters to match your repository. The `branch` query parameter is optional.

```markdown
[![Develop on Okteto](https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg)](https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main)
```

And here's the equivalent content as HTML if you prefer that:

```html
<a href="https://cloud.okteto.com/deploy?repository=https://github.com/okteto/movies&branch=main">
  <img src="https://okteto.com/develop-okteto.svg" alt="Develop on Okteto">
</a>
```

### Parameters

You can parametrize your development environment deployment using the following parameters:

- `repository`: The repository to be deployed.  If it's not present, Okteto will automatically infer it using the referer header, if available.
- `branch`: The repository branch to be deployed. If not included, it will use the default branch of the repository.
- `vars`: It allows you to specify a list of variables that will be available as environment variables during the deployment. It is optional. .e.g `vars=[{"name":"THEME","value":"dark"},{"name":"LANG","value":"en"}]`. This would generate 2 environment variables avaible on your deployment: `THEME=dark` and `LANG=en`. It has to be URL encoded.
- `filename`: The location of  the [Okteto Manifest](/docs/reference/manifest) relative to the root of the repository.
