Okteto Enterprise is a development platform for Kubernetes applications. Build better applications by developing and testing your code directly in your own Kubernetes infrastructure. Give your team the power of [Okteto Cloud](/docs/cloud/), with the control and flexibility of running in your Kubernetes infrastructure.

With Okteto Enterprise your team can:

- Get self-service access to your Kubernetes infrastructure. Forget about dealing with IAMs and account mappings and just login with your email account to get your [kubeconfig](/docs/cloud/credentials/).
- Automatically apply security policies, quotas, and access control to every user and deployment
- Create [secure Kubernetes namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces/) with one click
- Deploy your applications [from Git repositories](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-git/), [Docker Compose](/docs/tutorials/compose-getting-started/) files or [Helm charts](/docs/cloud/deploy-from-helm/)
- Visualize your workloads in a Developer-focused Kubernetes dashboard
- Get [automatic HTTPs endpoints](/docs/cloud/ssl/) for your services
- Configure [secrets](/docs/cloud/secrets/) and prevent secure credentials from being stored in version control
- [Download kubectl credentials](/docs/cloud/credentials/) to access your namespaces with `kubectl` or any other tool
- Develop directly in Okteto Cloud with the [Okteto CLI](https://github.com/okteto/okteto)
- Collaborate by [sharing](/docs/cloud/namespaces/#share-your-namespace) your namespaces with your teammates
- Keep your infrastructure under control with the Okteto [Garbage Collector](/docs/enterprise/administration/cleanup/) and the [Okteto Autoscaler](/docs/enterprise/administration/configuration/#autoscaler)
