Okteto's Development Environments enable you to work directly with a deployed application and see your code changes live on the cloud as soon as you hit save.

These dev environments work using a combination of Okteto Cloud, which is used to deploy your application, and Okteto CLI, which is used to attach a development container to the deployed application. This guide will walk you through how you can easily get started with using dev environments.

## Installing Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI following these steps:

### MacOS / Linux

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

You can also install via [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```console
$ brew install okteto
```

### Windows

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

You can also install via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running:

```console
$ scoop install okteto
```

### GitHub

Alternatively, you can directly download the binary [from GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases).

## Configuring Okteto CLI with Okteto Cloud

You'll be deploying your application on Okteto Cloud, and for this, the first thing you need to do is go and [log in](https://cloud.okteto.com). Once you've done that, you need to let Okteto CLI know that Okteto Cloud is where your application will be hosted. This is done by setting the context in Okteto CLI using:

```
okteto context use https://cloud.okteto.com
```

You have the option of creating multiple [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces) in Okteto Cloud. For this guide, we'll just use the default one, which gets created when you log in. Okteto CLI should automatically pick that Namespace up after you set the context. You can confirm this by running:

## Getting Your Application Ready

Configuring your application for remote development has multiple routes based on how you currently deploy it.

If you're using docker-compose and already have a `docker-compose.yaml` at the root of your application's repository, you're good to go. Feel free to move on to the [next part]() of the guide.

If you're using Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests,...[what else?] then you will need an Okteto Manifest in order to proceed. Once we run `okteto up` in the next part of this guide, Okteto CLI will automatically generate this manifest for you and help you configure it as per your application.

But suppose you don't have any of the above manifests in your repository. In that case, you can either write an Okteto Manifest directly for your application using the [Manifest reference](/docs/reference/manifest), or you can add either of the above-mentioned manifests (docker-compose, Helm, etc.) and proceed from there. If you need a sample application to proceed with this guide, you can use the movies app, which has all the required manifests set up.

## Next Steps

Now that you have everything configured let's get to the fun bit of creating and using our development environment. In the next part, we'll develop our deployed application and see our changes reflected live!

## More Info

[add links to more relevant areas]

<!-- [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com/#/?origin=docs) gives instant access to secure Kubernetes namespaces to enable developers to code, build, and run Kubernetes applications entirely in the cloud.

This tutorial will show you how to create an account in Okteto Cloud and how to develop a sample application.

## Step 1: Deploy the Movies App

Log in to [Okteto Cloud](https://cloud.okteto.com), and click on the **Deploy** button on the top left. A dialog will open asking for a Git repository URL to deploy.
Type the one for the Movies App repository (https://github.com/okteto/movies), pick a branch, and click **Deploy**:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src="/docs/images/deploy.png"
    alt="deploy an app with Okteto Cloud"
    width="600"
  />
</p>

The [Movies App](https://github.com/okteto/movies) is a simple web app composed of: a React frontend, a Node.js api, and a mongodb database.
When you deploy the Movies App Git repository, Okteto Cloud will run the deploy pipeline defined by the `okteto-pipeline.yml` of the repository.
In this case, the pipeline deploys the chart of the Movies App with Helm.

> Check the [docs](/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline/) to learn more about how to configure your `okteto-pipeline.yml` file.

At this point, your application is deploying. It will be ready to go once its components reach the `Running` state.

<p align="center">
  <Image src="/docs/images/ui-cloud.png" alt="Okteto Cloud UI" width="850" />
</p>

The Okteto Cloud dashboard is designed to be developer friendly. It gives you instant feedback about your applications logs, errors, metrics, and more.

Now click on the application's endpoint of the frontend component to access the Movies App. You should see something like this:

<p align="center">
  <Image
    src="/docs/images/ui-movies.png"
    alt="UI showing the movies app"
    width="850"
  />
</p>

Cool no ðŸ˜Ž? But ooh... seems like we have a bug in our application. The list of _Movies_ and the list of _Continue watching for Cindy_ are the same. Let's work on a fix now!

## Step 2: Install the Okteto CLI

Okteto provides a local development experience for Kubernetes applications. You code locally in your favorite IDE and Okteto automatically updates your application running in Kubernetes in seconds. No commit, build, push, or deploy required.

> The Okteto CLI is open source, and the code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto). It's a client-side only tool that works in any Kubernetes cluster. Check it out and star it to show your support ðŸ¤—!

If you haven't done it yet, install the Okteto CLI:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac-linux"
  values={[
    { label: 'MacOS / Linux', value: 'mac-linux', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="mac-linux">

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows">

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

More installation options are documented [here](/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## Step 3: Configure access to your Okteto Cloud namespace

The Okteto CLI can download your Kubernetes credentials from Okteto Cloud. To do this, you just need to run the context command:

```console
$ okteto context use https://cloud.okteto.com
```

```console
 âœ“  Using context cindy @ cloud.okteto.com
 i  Run 'okteto kubeconfig' to set your kubectl credentials
```

The `okteto context` configures the default context for any Okteto CLI command.
If you're not logged into Okteto Cloud yet, it also runs the login sequence.

## Step 4: Activate your development container

Clone the repo with the source code of the Movies App:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/okteto/movies
$ cd movies
```

And activate your development container to develop on the api component:

```console
$ cd api
$ okteto up
```

```console
 i  Using cindy @ cloud.okteto.com as context
 âœ“  Images successfully pulled
 âœ“  Files synchronized
    Namespace: cindy
    Name:      api
    Forward:   8080 -> 8080
               9229 -> 9229

Welcome to your development container. Happy coding!
cindy:api src>
```

The `okteto up` command starts a [development container](/docs/reference/development-environment/) in Okteto Cloud, which means:

- A [file synchronization service](/docs/reference/file-synchronization/) is created to keep your changes up-to-date between your local filesystem and your development container
- Container ports 8080 (the application) and 9229 (the debugger) are forwarded to localhost
- A remote shell is started in your development container. Build, test and run your application as if you were in your local machine.

> All of this (and more) can be customized via the `okteto.yml` [manifest file](/docs/reference/manifest/), which lives side by side with the application source code. Use the `.stignore` file to avoid synchronizing build artifacts, git metadata, or dependencies like `node_modules`.

Your development container inherits all the Kubernetes configuration of the original api deployment.
For example, the development container receives the database password via an environment variable.
To check it out, execute the following command in the development container shell:

```console
cindy:api src> env | grep MONGODB_PASSWORD
```

```console
MONGODB_PASSWORD=Password!1@2
```

Start the api service by executing the command below in the development container shell:

```console
cindy:api src> yarn start
```

```console
yarn run v1.19.1
$ nodemon server.js
[nodemon] 1.19.2
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching dir(s): *.*
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Go back to the browser and reload the Movies App. Check your development container shell and see how the traffic now goes through your development container:

```console
Server running on port 8080.
GET /api/movies
GET /api/watching
```

## Step 5: Development time!

Let's fix the bug of the Movies App.
Open the `server.js` file in your favorite local IDE and modify line 43 to query the `watching` collection instead of `movies`:

```javascript
  db.collection('watching').find().toArray( (err, results) =>{
```

Save your changes. Okteto will automatically synchronize your changes to your development container. Take a look at the development container shell and notice how the changes are detected by `nodemon` and automatically hot reloaded.

```console
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on port 8080.
```

Go back to the browser and reload the Movies App. Your code fixes were instantly applied! No commit, build, or push required ðŸ˜Ž.
