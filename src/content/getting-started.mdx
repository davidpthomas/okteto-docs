Okteto's Development Environments enable you to work directly with a deployed application and see your code changes live on the cloud as soon as you hit save.

These dev environments work using a combination of Okteto Cloud, which is used to deploy your application, and Okteto CLI, which is used to attach a development container to the deployed application. This guide will walk you through how you can easily get started with using dev environments.

## Installing Okteto CLI

Install the Okteto CLI following these steps:

### MacOS / Linux

```console
$ curl https://get.okteto.com -sSfL | sh
```

You can also install via [brew](https://brew.sh/) by running:

```console
$ brew install okteto
```

### Windows

Download https://downloads.okteto.com/cli/okteto.exe and add it to your `$PATH`.

You can also install via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) by running:

```console
$ scoop install okteto
```

### GitHub

Alternatively, you can directly download the binary [from GitHub](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/releases).

## Configuring Okteto CLI with Okteto Cloud

You'll be deploying your application on Okteto Cloud, and for this, the first thing you need to do is go and [log in](https://cloud.okteto.com). Once you've done that, you need to let Okteto CLI know that Okteto Cloud is where the development environment for your application will live. This is done by setting the context in Okteto CLI using:

```console
$ okteto context use https://cloud.okteto.com
```

You have the option of creating multiple [Namespaces](/docs/cloud/namespaces) in Okteto Cloud. For this guide, we'll just use the default one, which gets created when you log in. Okteto CLI should automatically pick that Namespace up after you set the context. You can confirm this by running:

```console
$ okteto context list                                                    ✔
Name                        Namespace             Builder                                 Registry
https://cloud.okteto.com *  rinkiyakedad          tcp://buildkit.cloud.okteto.net:1234    registry.cloud.okteto.net
```

## Getting Your Application Ready

Configuring your application for remote development has multiple routes based on how you currently deploy it.

If you're using docker-compose and already have a `docker-compose.yaml` at the root of your application's repository, you're good to go. Feel free to move on to the [next part](/docs/using-dev-envs) of the guide.

If you're using Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests,...[what else?] then you will need an Okteto Manifest in order to proceed. Once we run `okteto up` in the next part of this guide, Okteto CLI will automatically generate this manifest for you and help you configure it as per your application. However, if you want to create the manifest right now, you can run

```console
$ okteto manifest init
```

This will analyze your existing manifests and walk you through creating your Okteto Manifest based on them. `okteto up` also runs this same command for you if it doesn't find an Okteto Manifest.

But suppose you don't have any of the above manifests in your repository. In that case, you can either write an Okteto Manifest directly for your application using the [Manifest reference](/docs/reference/manifest), or you can add either of the above-mentioned manifests (docker-compose, Helm, etc.) and proceed from there. If you need a sample application to follow through with this guide, you can use our sample [movies app](https://github.com/okteto/movies), which has all the required manifests set up.

## Next Steps

Now that you have everything configured let's get to the fun bit of creating and using our development environment. In the next part, we'll develop our deployed application and see our changes reflected live!
